# QwenCraft

**Crafting Intelligent Solutions with Qwen-Max and LangChain4j**

QwenCraft is a next-generation AI programming assistant built with Java, leveraging **Qwen-Max** and **LangChain4j** to empower developers with intelligent code generation, real-time editing, and seamless deployment. Designed for both individual developers and enterprise teams, QwenCraft streamlines the entire development lifecycle ‚Äî from idea to deployment.

## üåü Core Capabilities

### 1. **Smart Code Generation**
Describe your requirements in natural language, and QwenCraft automatically analyzes the intent, selects the optimal strategy, and generates code via AI-powered tool calls. With **streaming output**, you can see the code being generated in real time, enhancing transparency and trust.

### 2. **Visual Editing Interface**
Instantly preview the generated application in a live editor. Enter edit mode to interactively modify UI elements by simply talking to the AI. Adjust layout, style, or functionality through natural language ‚Äî iterate quickly until the result meets your expectations.

### 3. **One-Click Deployment & Sharing**
Deploy your application to the cloud with a single click. QwenCraft automatically captures a cover image and generates a shareable public URL. You can also download the complete source code package for local use or further development.

### 4. **Enterprise-Grade Management**
Built-in admin panel for enterprise needs:
- User and application management
- System performance monitoring
- AI usage analytics and business metrics
- Curated app showcase and access control

Administrators can monitor AI invocation statistics, system health, and user activities to ensure stability and security at scale.

## üîß Key Technical Features

QwenCraft integrates cutting-edge AI engineering practices to deliver a robust and scalable developer experience:

- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**  
  Seamless integration with **Qwen-Max** via API, enabling natural language understanding and code generation.

- **Conversation Memory**  
  Supports persistent and context-aware conversations using chat history management, allowing multi-turn interaction with consistent context.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Enhances AI responses with domain-specific knowledge from a vector database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date code suggestions and documentation.

- **Tool Calling**  
  Enables the AI agent to invoke external functions (e.g., file creation, API calls, code formatting), turning LLMs into actionable assistants.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
  Implements the **MCP** standard for structured communication between AI models and tools, improving interoperability and context management.

- **Observability & Monitoring**  
  Full observability with logging, tracing (OpenTelemetry), and metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) to track AI latency, error rates, and system performance.

- **Streaming Output**  
  Real-time token streaming for responsive user experience during long-generation tasks.

- **Cloud-Native & Extensible Architecture**  
  Designed with modularity in mind, supporting plugins, custom tools, and easy integration into CI/CD pipelines.
